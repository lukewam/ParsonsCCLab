      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
       This clock is inspired by the oriental elegancy and romantic spirit, 
       that time should not be just a number but a part of nature and art. 
       In nature, flowers are one representation of the time, since flowers and leaves are seasonal, 
       and the sun is changing along the day. I want everything to be a whole thing, no number, no clock hand, nothing but only painting itself.
      <br>
      <br>
        In this project, leaves are representing the hours, the flowers are representing minutes, the sun is representing the day and night. 
        The number of leaf is current hour, in 12 hour format. If there is a sun, it is first 12 hours of the day. 
        If there is no sun, it is the second 12 hours of the day. The number of flower is how many 5 minutes has pass in current hour, just like a grid in a clock.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, in the morning, 8:08 would be a sun, 8 leaves, 2 flowers.
        <br>
        <br>
        My three ideas are more like a process of thinking. From the most basic, using number to represent time, 
        and clock hand to represent the time, to this, I keep thinking about how I can do differently than the traditional representation.
        <br>
        <br>
        What I learn from this assignment is that coding is just a tool for the art making. My codes are not that complex, but it does has a good artistic outcome.
