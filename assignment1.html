      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
       my partner said that he was looking out of a window, and the window has grid. The window has circular pattern.
        There are pine trees and a beach behind the pine trees. The view is located at 7th floor, and there is a bird flying. <br>
        <br>
        My own interpretation is a view of a ocean and pine trees at the side.
        At first I was thinking about circular patterns at a lot of small circles on the window, and there are four panels on the window.<br>
        <br>
        However, along the stage I realized that as an image itself, the initial design does not look aesthetically appalling.
         It has to look good at first, and the composition is way too complex. I minimized the circular pattern to big circles to reduce the complexity at the center. I also simplified the window.<br> 
         <br>
        In general, the image would be 4 squares at the edges as window, 4 circles at the center as window patterns, some triangles and a rectangle as a pine tree.
         It's hard to come up with the depiction of a bird. It's made up with two circles as body and three triangles as tail and wings.
